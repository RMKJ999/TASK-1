# TASK-1
implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. This project involved:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Selecting relevant features and handling missing values.

2. **Model Training**: Using Pythonâ€™s `scikit-learn` to train a linear regression model.

3. **Evaluation and Prediction**: Calculating RMSE and making predictions on test data.

it,

- Enhanced my understanding of data preprocessing and feature selection.

- Gained practical experience in model evaluation using RMSE.

- Improved my skills in Python and `scikit-learn`.

This hands-on project was a fantastic opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data. Looking forward to more challenges and learning experiences!
